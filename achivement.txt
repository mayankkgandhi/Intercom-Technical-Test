Situation: I took over the responsibility of building the "Food Ordering Messenger Chatbot" product from scratch within one month of joining 
as my CTO resigned in the initial days of my employment, citing health reasons. I was assigned to design and to build the core product by the CEO. 
Since it was the primary product, there was tremendous pressure as our clientele and revenue depended on this product.

Behaviour: This was a challenging task and had a steep learning curve as I had fairly little idea about chatbots. I collaborated with initial clients 
to define contracts, gather their requirements and expectations, and promised three months of delivery. I established a project plan with the CEO for 
multiple milestones, including a product launch date.

Impact: I delivered the messenger bot on time and increased our clientele from 2 clients to 14 clients within six months of product launch with an 
increase in revenue by 35%. I'm most proud of this product because it was a vital win for the Start-up, and this project helped me grow tremendously 
in terms of leadership and technical skills.
